<Section type="intro">

In the first part of this series, we have set up ESLint and Prettier to enforce coding standards and best practices for a React project.

But what if you forget to run them? 🤔 If you commit code without formatting it first, all that setup work is wasted. Plus, running these lints on the whole project can take a lot of time to check and format all files 🐢. What we really want is to only check and format the files we're about to commit. That's where Husky and lint-staged step in.

In this post, I will guide you through the process of setting up Husky and lint-staged to automatically run lints and format code before committing.

## What is Husky and lint-staged?

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) is a tool that allows you to run scripts before committing or pushing code to the repository.

- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) is a tool that allows you to run scripts (run lints in this case) on files that are staged in Git.

By combining Husky and lint-staged, we can run ESLint and Prettier on the files that are about to be committed:

## Configuration

First, let's install Husky and lint-staged as dev dependencies:

<BlockCode>

```bash
npm install husky lint-staged --save-dev
```

</BlockCode>

Next, run the following command to initialize Husky:

<BlockCode>

```bash
npx husky init
```

</BlockCode>

This command will create a pre-commit script in `.husky/` and updates the `prepare` script in `package.json`.

Update the `.husky/pre-commit` file with the following content:

<BlockCode>

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

</BlockCode>

Next, we need to configure lint-staged in the `package.json` file:

<BlockCode fileName='package.json'>

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint . --fix --ext .ts,.tsx", "prettier --write ."]
  }
}
```

</BlockCode>

Now, when you commit your code, Husky will run `lint-staged`, which will run ESLint and Prettier on all staged files.

## Try it out

To test if everything is set up correctly, create a new `.tsx` file and make the commit, you should see ESLint and Prettier run:

  alt="ESLint and Prettier running on commit"

  width="1804"
/>

If there are any errors, Husky will prevent the commit and display the error message.

## Conclusion

Welldone! 🎉 We have set up ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for a React project to enforce coding standards and ensure code quality and consistency. By using these tools, you can maintain a clean and consistent codebase, making it easier for developers to collaborate and maintain the project.
